# Blog in React	

Hello, I'm Tomek,

I'm glad you have a moment to take a look at this React-based project. I'd like to welcome you to my blog, which serves as a demonstration of my skills and dedication to developing web applications.

Within this project, I've created a dynamic blog with various functionalities. I've implemented registration, login, and password recovery mechanisms that provide users with a personalized experience. A key aspect is restricting access to articles only for logged-in users, aiming to enhance interaction on the website.

It's worth noting the administrator account, which holds content management privileges. Through it, I can add, edit, and remove articles using an intuitive administrative panel. I consider this a crucial feature, enabling effective content management for the website.

Furthermore, I've prepared a special preview account, granting insight into administrator account functionalities, albeit with limitations on certain actions such as password and email changes, as well as editing, adding, and removing articles. I've implemented these restrictions with security in mind.

If you'd like to explore my project, I warmly invite you to log in using the provided credentials:

Thank you for taking the time to familiarize yourself with my skills and project.

Best regards,

Tomek
